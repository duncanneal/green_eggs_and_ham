I am Sam
Sam I am

That Sam-I-am
That Sam-I-am!
I do not like that Sam-I-am

I do not like them, Sam-I-am.
I do not like green eggs and ham.

I would not like them here or there.
I would not like them anywhere.
I do not like green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-I-am

Would you like them in a house?
Would you like them with a mouse?

I do not like them in a house.
I do not like them with a mouse.
I do not like them here or there.
I do not like them anywhere.
I do not like green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-I-am.
